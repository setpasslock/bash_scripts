for those who are tired of visiting the site from the browser every time when using the vpnbook :D

# installation
just run the script

# little notes
When I first wrote this script, I planned to do an IP-based check to see if it works, but when I did the first IP check on my network, the public IP was always different (I still don't clearly understand why). So I did the check by country. 

For example, if you want to connect from Poland to a Poland server, keep this in mind. You might want to review the script to make a few changes.
